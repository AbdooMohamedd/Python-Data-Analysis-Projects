## Introduction

This project aims to analyze movie data to understand various correlations and trends within the movie industry. The insights gained from this analysis can help in understanding the factors that contribute to a movie's success.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis includes information on movies such as ratings, genres, release dates, scores, votes, directors, writers, stars, country of origin, budget, gross earnings, production companies, and runtime.

## Sample Data

Here is a sample of the data:

| name | rating | genre | year | released | score | votes | director | writer | star | country | budget | gross | company | runtime |
|------|--------|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|----------|--------|------|---------|--------|-------|---------|---------|
| The Shining | R | Drama | 1980 | June 13, 1980 (United States) | 8.4 | 927000.0 | Stanley Kubrick | Stephen King | Jack Nicholson | United Kingdom | 19000000.0 | 46998772.0 | Warner Bros. | 146.0 |
| The Blue Lagoon | R | Adventure | 1980 | July 2, 1980 (United States) | 5.8 | 65000.0 | Randal Kleiser | Henry De Vere Stacpoole | Brooke Shields | United States | 4500000.0 | 58853106.0 | Columbia Pictures | 104.0 |
| Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back | PG | Action | 1980 | June 20, 1980 (United States) | 8.7 | 1200000.0 | Irvin Kershner | Leigh Brackett | Mark Hamill | United States | 18000000.0 | 538375067.0 | Lucasfilm | 124.0 |
| Airplane! | PG | Comedy | 1980 | July 2, 1980 (United States) | 7.7 | 221000.0 | Jim Abrahams | Jim Abrahams | Robert Hays | United States | 3500000.0 | 83453539.0 | Paramount Pictures | 88.0 |
| Caddyshack | R | Comedy | 1980 | July 25, 1980 (United States) | 7.3 | 108000.0 | Harold Ramis | Brian Doyle-Murray | Chevy Chase | United States | 6000000.0 | 39846344.0 | Orion Pictures | 98.0 |

## Analysis

The analysis involves the following steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data entries.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.
3. Visualization: Creating visualizations to present the insights gained from the analysis.

## Visualizations

Various visualizations are created to help understand the data better, including:
- Correlation heatmaps between different attributes
- Distribution of genres, ratings, and release years
- Box plots of budgets and gross earnings by genre

## Technologies Used

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. The project contains a Jupyter notebook with the full analysis and visualizations.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Python-Data-Analysis-Projects.git
cd Python-Data-Analysis-Projects/Movie correlation, EDA and visualizations
```

## Future Work

Future improvements to this project may include:
- More detailed analysis of specific genres or directors
- Integration of additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis
