## Introduction

This project aims to analyze credit card spending data in India to understand spending habits and trends. The insights gained from this analysis can help in understanding consumer behavior and making data-driven decisions.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis includes information on credit card transactions made by individuals in India. The data includes various attributes such as transaction amount, category, and date.

## Sample Data

Here is a sample of the data:

| index | City                  | Date       | Card Type | Exp Type | Gender | Amount |
|-------|-----------------------|------------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 0     | Delhi, India          | 29/10/2014 | Gold      | Bills    | F      | 82475  |
| 1     | Greater Mumbai, India | 22/08/2014 | Platinum  | Bills    | F      | 32555  |
| 2     | Bengaluru, India      | 27/08/2014 | Silver    | Bills    | F      | 101738 |
| 3     | Greater Mumbai, India | 12/04/2014 | Signature | Bills    | F      | 123424 |
| 4     | Bengaluru, India      | 05/05/2015 | Gold      | Bills    | F      | 171574 |
| 5     | Delhi, India          | 08/09/2014 | Silver    | Bills    | F      | 100036 |

## Analysis

The analysis involves the following steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data entries.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.
3. Visualization: Creating visualizations to present the insights gained from the analysis.

## Visualizations

Various visualizations are created to help understand the data better, including:
- Spending trends over time
- Category-wise spending distribution
- Correlation between different variables

## Technologies Used

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. The project contains a Jupyter notebook with the full analysis and visualizations.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Python-Data-Analysis-Projects.git
cd Python-Data-Analysis-Projects/Credit card spending - India EDA and visualisation
```

## Future Work

Future improvements to this project may include:
- More detailed analysis of specific spending categories
- Integration of additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis
