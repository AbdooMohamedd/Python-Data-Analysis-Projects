# Python Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to the Python Data Analysis Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects that involve cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating visualizations to extract insights. The projects utilize various Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and more.

## Projects

### 1. [Credit Card Spending - India EDA and Visualization](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Python-Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Credit%20card%20spending%20-%20India%20EDA%20and%20visualisation)
Explores credit card spending patterns in India, identifying trends and visualizing spending habits across different categories.

### 2. [Microsoft Stock Analysis](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Python-Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Microsoft%20Stock%20Analysis)
Analyzes Microsoft's stock performance, including time series analysis and visualization of stock price trends.

### 3. [Movie Correlation, EDA, and Visualizations](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Python-Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Movie%20correlation%2C%20EDA%20and%20visualizations)
Analyzes movie data to uncover correlations and patterns, with visualizations of trends in the movie industry.

### 4. [World Population EDA and Visualization](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Python-Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/World%20Population%20EDA%20and%20visualisation)
Examines world population data, identifying trends and visualizing population growth and distribution across regions.

## Technologies Used

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, clone the repository and navigate to the respective project directory. Each project contains a Jupyter notebook with the full analysis and visualizations.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Python-Data-Analysis-Projects.git
cd Python-Data-Analysis-Projects
```

## Future Work
I plan to add more data analysis projects to this repository in the future. Stay tuned for more insightful analyses and visualizations!
